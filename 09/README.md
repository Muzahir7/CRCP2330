The project that I have worked on is a chase game where one square chases the other square.
The project folder is name "Catch_Mouse". It contains all the files that are used to run this game.

Instruction for the Catch_Game or The Chase Game:
It is a 2 players game in which on would be controlling the small square which is jerry the mouse
and the other would be controlling the bigger square which is tom the cat.
Jerry's job is to stay away from tom as much as possible and tom's job is to chase jerry.
If tom collides with jerry and player who controls tom presses the space bar tom catehes 
jeerry and wins the game.

Control instructions:
Jerry's control:
Use left arrow key, right arrow key, down arrow key and up arrow key to move jerry in left direction,
right direction, down direction and up direction respectively.
Tom's control:
Use A key, D key, S key and W key to move tom in left direction,
right direction, down direction and up direction respectively.
And press space bar when close to jerry inorder to catch jerry.
